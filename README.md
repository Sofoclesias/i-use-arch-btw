# I use Arch btw

Dotfiles of my Arch Linux configuration, both in desktop design, application fixes and .

This repository is both a personal cloud back up and a hub to replicate effortlessly my configurations in any Arch Linux system. As of now, all trials are being applied in my laptop; however, in the future I'd like to migrate all to my workstation for the heavier workflows.

COMING SOON:

 * Shell command to auto-configure everything (just for me, you know it's dangerous to run system-altering codes from randoms on the internet.)
 * Other applications I may build in the future (don't count on that) will be in open-sourced in other repository.
 * A better README.md file because I like pretty things.

Sí, soy un inkchable. ¿Y qué?
