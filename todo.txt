   Tailoring Arch Linux for my needs.
   Last updated: Vie., 6/12/24, 23:18.


   |> Desktop Environment <|

      + [6/12/2024] Develop a pretty set of workspaces for Hyprland.
              (+ I think it's pretty so far. Later, I'll make the backgrounds more clear and get more videos to pivot)
          - Make pivoteable backgrounds.

      + [6/12/2024] Get OBS to work and record screen (to brag about my desktop :p)
          + [6/12/2024] Solve problems with audio daemons
              (+ There was no issue with the audio drivers. In wayland, as the documentation said, I needed to set up some extra programs and environmental variables.)

      - Configure my own Neovim interface.

      - Configure Clipboard history.
     
   |> Self-Hosting <|

      - Configure and run Dockers.
      
      - Configure and run Kubernetes. 
          - The pages in the server should be accessible to any user in a safe SSH connection, like a serverless cloud service.
          - Be able to deploy dockers in Kubernetes.

      - Configure and run qBitTorrent.

   |> Daemons and Drivers <|

      - Share screen in:
          + [6/12/2024] OBS
          - Discord
          - Teams
          - Meets

      - [?] Configure Wine and Proton to play Steam and Non-Steam games.

      - [?] Configure RetroArch.

      - [?] Install NVIDIA drivers and assert compatibility with:
          - Videogames
          - Pytorch and Tensorflow
          - Blender
          - Bottom (to show usage.)

   |> Reproducibility <|

      - Support the github repository of i-use-arch-btw with my latest changes.
          - Until I clean all this TO-DO.
      
      - Trace the programs and tools that I use, in order to replicate my whole Arch Linux setup in my Workstation.
